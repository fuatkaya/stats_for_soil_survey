The final project is intended to give you an opportunity to practice the skills covered in this course. Your mentor will be available to assist you with your project should you encounter difficulties. There should be time available during the last day of the course to begin your project. You are strongly encouraged to use your own data, but you may select one of the datasets provided during the class. Examples of previously successful projects are listed below.

Your project should follow the outline listed below, which generally represents the minimum requirement for all NASIS projects and scientific reports. Keep in mind, just because this course was taught online, doesn't mean it was intended to be any easier than say SGI, nor held to a lesser level. Projects that are incomplete will be returned with feedback, and the participants will be given another try.

- Objective or hypothesis
- Study area
- Results
- Conclusion or Discussion


## Objective(s)

Describe the objective of your project or a hypothesis that you wish to test. Also, briefly discuss the methods that will be used. Communication is key. If you can't explain what your doing and why you're doing it, why should anyone care. It is not necessary construct an elaborate objective or hypothesis. Often small concrete examples are best. For example, comparing two similar soils or ecosites are great because they provide some context from which to interpret the results.

Apply techniques learned from the part of the course you're enrolled in.

  * __Part 1:__ Use techniques from chapter 1 - 4
  * __Part 2:__ Use techniges from chapter 1 - 4 AND 5 - 8. 
  

## Study Area

Briefly describe the dataset you selected and the geographic setting. Be sure to include a map.  

If you plan to use spatial data, be sure to develop all of the associated data layers. Your data will need to share a common projection, resolution, extent, GDAL format (ideally img or tiff), be modest in extent (~2,000 x 2,000 cells) and be co-registered. **Ideally, use a dataset that has been prepared previously**.

If you choose to use a project area from one of the classroom examples, spatial data will be available.


## Results

Describe your results. Include examples of both descriptive statistics and graphical methods. Include the code used to generate your results.


## Discussion

Discuss how these results: 

   1. help in understanding the problem and
   2. influence current and future investigations
   3. how do your results compare to other studies or the conventional wisdom

## Due Date

Febuary 29th, 2020


## Formatting

You can compile your final project report using several methods. Note that copying/pasting from R to Word will often corrupt code that contains single or double quotes. The R-based formats are quite simple and allow you to seamlessly combine narrative, code, output, and figures into a self-contained HTML file. [Note about reproduceable research here.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).
