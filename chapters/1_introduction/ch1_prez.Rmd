## Course Objectives

- Develop solutions to investigate soil survey correlation problems and update activities.
- Evaluate investigations for interpretive results and determine how to proceed.
- Create a continuous surface from point data.
- Summarize data for populations in NASIS.
- Help to pursue the question "why" 

---

## Why is this training needed?

- Long standing goal of the Soil Science Division to have a course in statistics
- Opportunities to learn these techniques are limited, especially at the undergraduate level
- Consistent methodology (data analysis, data population, sampling design, etc.)
- There is continually a greater need to use these techniques:
- Mapping of lands at high production rates
    - Ecological Sites
    - Soil survey refinement (disaggregation) 

---

## Why is course organized this way?

- Our best judgement for assembling into 24 hours what could be 6 University level courses
- Mixture of slides and script enabled web pages is new for NRCS
- The web content is a long-term investment and should serve as a permanent reference
- Feel free to provide guidance for improving the class for future offerings

## What is R? - Open Source Project

1. a software environment: statistics, graphics, programming, calculator, GIS, etc...

2. a language: vocabulary to explore, summarize, and model data

## What is R? - "One Tool""

![*ODBC and GDAL link R to nearly all possible formats/interfaces*](static-figures/triangle.png){ width=50% }


---


## Why should I use R? - 3 Reasons!

1. Cost. R is free! ["Free as in free speech, not free beer"!](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

2. [Reproducible Research](http://christophergandrud.github.io/RepResR-RStudio/) (*self-documenting, repeatable*)
    + repeatable: 
        + code + output in a single document *('I want the right answer, not a quick answer' - Paul Finnell)*
        + easier the next time ([humorous example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=s3JldKoA0zw))
        + numerous Excel horror stories of scientific studies gone wrong exist ([TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXKbkpilQME))
    + scalable: applicable to small or large problems

3. R in a Community
    + [Numerous Discipline Specific R Groups](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
    + [Numerous Local R User Groups (including R-Ladies Groups)](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html#north-america)
    + [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

4. Learning Resources *(quantity and quality)*
    + [R books](https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html)
    + [(Free Online) R Books](https://bookdown.org/)

5.  R is 'becoming' the new norm (paradigm shift?). "If we don't accept these challenges, other who are less qualified will; and soil scientists will be displaced by apathy." [(Arnold and Wilding, 1992)](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/books/abstracts/sssaspecialpubl/spatialvariabil/1)

## What can R do? - Packages
* Base R (*functionality is extended through packages*)
    + basic summaries of quantitative or qualitative data
    + data exploration via graphics
    + [GIS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) data processing and analysis

* Soil Science R Packages
    + [aqp](https://github.com/ncss-tech/aqp) - visualization, aggregation, classification
    + [soilDB](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB) - access to commonly used soil databases
    + [soilReports](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilReports) - handful of report templates
    + [soiltexture](http://soiltexture.r-forge.r-project.org/) - textural triangles

* [Ecology](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Environmetrics.html) R packages
    + [vegan](http://vegan.r-forge.r-project.org/) - ordination, diversity analysis, etc...
    + [dismo](http://rspatial.org/sdm/) -  species distribution modeling

## Importing and Exporting Text Files

* [Beware of Excel Files](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/26/an-alarming-number-of-scientific-papers-contain-excel-errors/?utm_term=.9352a35dca6f)

## Viewing Data

![](figure/ch1_str_sand.png){ width=40% }

Function  | Description                                         |
----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
`print()` | prints the entire object (avoid with large tables)  |
`head()`  | prints the first 6 lines of your data               |
`str()`   | shows the data structure of an R object             |
`names()` | lists the column names (i.e., headers) of your data |
`ls()`    | lists all the R objects in your workspace directory |


---


## Removing Data

![](figure/ch1_clear_workspace.png){ width=40% }

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Remove all R objects
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE)) 

# Remove individal objects
rm(sand)

```

## Getting Help

![](figure/ch1_help_tab.png){ width=40% }

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Help file for a function
help(read.csv) # or ?read.csv

# Help files for a package
help(package = "soiltexture")
```

## Installing Packages

![](figure/ch1_install_packages.png){ width=80% }

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# CRAN (static version)
installed.packages(c("aqp", "soilDB", "soilReports", "soiltexture"))

# GitHub (development version)
devtools::install_github("ncss-tech/soilDB", dependencies = FALSE, upgrade_dependencies = FALSE)

library(soilDB)
```


---


## Basic Tips of Scripting

![](figure/ch1_text_editor.png){ width=50%}

* Place each function (e.g. `read.csv()`) on a separate line.
* If a function has a long list of arguments, place each argument on a separate line.
* A command can be excuted from the text editor by placing the cursor on a line and typing **Crtl + Enter**, or by **clicking** the Run button.
* An entire R script file can be excuted by **clicking** the Source button.

## Saving R Files

* Don't save your scripts in Word!

```{r, echo=FALSE}

rfiles <- data.frame(
  'File Type' = c("R Script", "R Markdown", "R Workspace", "R History"),
  'File Extension' = c(".R", ".Rmd", ".RData", ".RHistory"),
  Description = c("text file of R commands",
                  "text file of R commands formatted in Markdown",
                  "copy R objects from your workspace",
                  "copy all of commands sumbitted to the R Console"
                  ),
  check.names = FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )

knitr::kable(rfiles)

```

## Review

Given what you now know about R, try to answer the following questions:

1. Can you think of a situation where an existing hypothesis or convientional wisdom was not repeatable?

2. What are packages?

3. What is GitHub?

4. Where can you get help?

5. What does the file .Rprofile do?

6. What do you hope to get out of this class?
